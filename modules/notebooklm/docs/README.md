# NotebookLM Documentation

Implementation-level documentation for the notebooklm bounded context.

## Strategic Documentation (Authority)

Strategic architecture documentation lives in `docs/contexts/notebooklm/`:

- [README.md](../../../docs/contexts/notebooklm/README.md) — Context overview
- [subdomains.md](../../../docs/contexts/notebooklm/subdomains.md) — Subdomain inventory
- [bounded-contexts.md](../../../docs/contexts/notebooklm/bounded-contexts.md) — Ownership map
- [context-map.md](../../../docs/contexts/notebooklm/context-map.md) — Relationships
- [ubiquitous-language.md](../../../docs/contexts/notebooklm/ubiquitous-language.md) — Terminology

## Architecture Reference

- [Bounded Context Template](../../../docs/bounded-context-subdomain-template.md) — Standard structure
- [Architecture Overview](../../../docs/architecture-overview.md) — System-wide architecture
- [Integration Guidelines](../../../docs/integration-guidelines.md) — Cross-context rules

## Current Sync Points

- Workspace route authority stays outside notebooklm: when local implementation docs mention shell-facing navigation, point to the canonical workspace route `/{accountId}/{workspaceId}` owned by workspace composition.
- Identifier authority must remain explicit: `accountId` is account scope, `workspaceId` is workspace scope, `organizationId` is an internal organization-scoped token for source/synthesis flows, and it must not be documented as a shell route param.
- If notebooklm implementation notes mention AI, keep ownership aligned with the root baseline: platform owns shared AI capability; notebooklm owns local retrieval, grounding, synthesis, and evaluation language.
- System-wide baseline remains the root architecture set: Hexagonal + DDD, Firebase serverless backend, Genkit orchestration, Zustand/XState frontend state, and Zod runtime validation.

## Conflict Resolution

- Strategic docs in `docs/contexts/notebooklm/` are the authority for naming, ownership, and boundaries.
- This `docs/` folder is for implementation-aligned detail only.
