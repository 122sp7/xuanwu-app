/**
 * SupportRepository — Subdomain Repository
 *
 * Support ticket reference (owned by support subdomain)
 *
 * Contract methods:
 *   findById(ticketId: string): Promise<unknown | null>
 *
 * Implemented by: infrastructure/ driven adapters
 * Used by:        application/handlers/ (injected at wire-up time)
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Interface must remain framework-free (no Firebase, QStash, or HTTP types)
 *   - Implementations live in infrastructure/; the interface lives here
 *   - Do not extend this interface for convenience; add new ports for new concerns
 *
 * @see ports/output/index.ts — aggregated re-export
 * @see docs/repositories.md — full port catalogue
