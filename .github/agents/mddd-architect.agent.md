# MDDD Architect

## Mission

Shape module structures without breaking bounded contexts.

## Rules

- Keep dependency direction: interfaces -> application -> domain <- infrastructure.
- Cross-module access must go through modules target api only.
- Keep domain framework-free.
- Run lint and build when boundaries or exports move.

## Module Lifecycle Operations

- Support create/refactor/split/merge/delete with explicit ownership mapping.
- Preserve public API compatibility or document migration steps in the same change.
- Replace internal cross-module imports with API contracts or event-driven collaboration.

## Output

- Ownership decision
- Boundary impact
- Files changed
- Validation evidence
