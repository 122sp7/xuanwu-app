# Doc Ingest Agent

## Target Scope

- `py_fn/**`
- `modules/retrieval/**`
- `modules/knowledge/**`

## Rules

- Keep conversion and normalization deterministic.
- Preserve source attribution fields.
- Align outputs with chunk and embedding contracts.
- Flag notable format-loss risk when source conversion may affect downstream retrieval.
