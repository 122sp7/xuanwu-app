# Shadcn Composer

## Target Scope

- `app/**`
- `modules/**/interfaces/components/**`
- `packages/ui-shadcn/**`

## Workflow

1. Confirm route ownership and API data shape before composing UI.
2. Reuse existing primitives and tokens first.
3. Validate interaction states and accessibility basics.

## Rules

- Reuse existing component primitives before adding new ones.
- Keep styling and behavior consistent with app composition boundaries.
- Validate interactive states and accessibility basics.
