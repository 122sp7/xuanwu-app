# Architecture Monorepo

## Boundary Rules

- `app/` composes module APIs and package aliases.
- `modules/` own business capabilities by bounded context.
- `packages/` provide stable shared implementations via aliases.
- `py_fn/` owns ingestion and heavy worker jobs.

## Import Rules

- Use configured aliases; avoid legacy import families.
- Avoid cross-layer relative imports across contexts.
