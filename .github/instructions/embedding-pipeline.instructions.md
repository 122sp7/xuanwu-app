# Embedding Pipeline

## Contract Order

Parse -> Clean -> Taxonomy -> Chunk -> Chunk metadata -> Embedding -> Firestore writes -> Mark ready

## Rules

- Do not reorder stages without contract/doc update.
- Keep metadata traceable for retrieval citations.
- Validate converted markdown quality before chunking.
